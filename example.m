% EXAMPLE This is an example no-op function that reads in a mesh (V,F) and
% outputs that mesh. 
%
% [V,F] = example(V,F);
%
% Inputs:
%   V  #V by 3 list of mesh vertex positions
%   F  #F by 3 list of mesh triangle indices into rows of V (MATLAB 1-based
%     indices)
% Outputs:
%   V  #V by 3 list of mesh vertex positions
%   F  #F by 3 list of mesh triangle indices into rows of V (MATLAB 1-based
%     indices)
